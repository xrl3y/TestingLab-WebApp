# TestingLab-WebApp
A dynamic web application designed as a testing laboratory for experimenting with various web development features, tools, and integrations. This project serves as a sandbox environment to prototype, debug, and enhance skills in frontend and backend technologies.

## Features
- Fully customizable PHP scripts for backend logic.
- A variety of frontend implementations for learning and experimentation.
- Includes common security vulnerabilities for penetration testing practice.
- Compatible with local servers (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or Docker).

## Purpose
This project is intended for:
1. Web developers looking to prototype and debug their code.
2. Students or professionals seeking to enhance their skills in web application development.
3. Ethical hackers who want a safe environment to practice penetration testing techniques on intentionally vulnerable code.

## Getting Started
